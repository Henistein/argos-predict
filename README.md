# Argos Predict
Open source [prediction markets](https://richardhanania.substack.com/p/futarchy-robin-hanson-on-how-prediction) running on [cheap eth](https://cheapeth.org/), a low cost [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) sidechain.

I'm running a trial prediction market to predict the [FRED seasonally adjusted labor force participation rate](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CIVPART) in June 2022. There's a series of tokens representing possible ranges for the labor force participation rate, and tokens that correctly predict the final value pay out for 1 cth. The market is being subsidized with 10,000 cth to encourage participation.
